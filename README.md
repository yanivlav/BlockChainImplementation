***

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
A simple blockchain implementing  project written in node.js


For Begginers: Go trough Step 0-4 for better understanding.
Make sure that you are fimiliar with all concepts in stage before moving on to the next one.
Eech lesson folder contains two files main[x].js and blockchain[x].js where x is lesson's number (main[x] is used for our testings).

Lesson0
  simple blockchain: Block and BlockChain classes

Lesson1
  adding the isChainValid() to BlockChain

Lesson2
  Adding to mineBlock() to Block

Lesson3
  Adding Transaction Class
  
  Removing addBlock() from Block
  
  Adding minePendingTransactions(miningRewardAddress), getBalanceOfAddress(address), createTransaction(transaction) in BlockChain

Lesson4
  Changing createTransaction(transaction) to addTransaction(transaction) in BlockChain
  
  Add hasValidTransaction() to Block
  
  Before moving on:
  
  Read about Bloomfilter and MerkleTree that we are going to use in our blockchain and go check the folder "Components Examples" for better understanding.
  (Lesson4/"Trying to implement MerkelTree" folder has some examples too)
 
   Now go checkout blockchain4.js and test file main.js in the root directory.
